## Anna Tran's first App!

### App Description
This is an app I created with the help of codepath. This is a simple app in which I made the background yellow but if you click "Change View Color", then the background color will change. If you click on "Change Text Color", the text displayed on the screen will change into a color that I picked. You can also input your own text and then click "Change Text" to have it displayed on the screen. Want to go back to the yellow screen? Hit anywhere on the screen that's green! It will take you back to the beginning.
